    <h>Computer Hardware</h>
    <p style="font-size:30">On this page iw ill be talking about computer hardware, like different parts of the computer itself. I will be describing each parrt a little bit but not way in depth. Just describing what each part is and what is does.
        <h1 style="font-size:30"><u>Motherboard</h1>
        <p style="font-size:30">The motherboard is a printed circuit board containing the principal components of a computer or other device, with connectors into which other circuit boards can be slotted. The motherboard connects all parts of the computer together. It connects thigns like the CPU, memory, hard drives, optical drives, sound card, and many other things. They are all connected by either expansion cards or cables.</p>

        <h2 style="font-size:30"><u>CPU</h2>
        <p style="font-size:30">What is CPU? CPU is the abbreviation for central processing unit. Sometimes referred to simply as the central processor, but more commonly called processor, the CPU is the brains of the computer where most calculations take place. The CPU is the brains of the computer where most calculations take place.</p>
        <img style="height: 200" ; src="http://www.eurotech.com/images/products/CPU-1484/CPU-1484.jpg" <h3 style="font-size:30"><u>RAM</h3>
    <p style="font-size:30">RAM is an acronym for Random Access Memory. a type of computer memory that can be accessed randomly; that is, any byte of memory can be accessed without touching the preceding bytes. RAM is the most common type of memory found in computers and other devices.</p> <img style="height: 200"; src="http://www.downloadmoreram.com/images/ram2.jpg"
<h4 style="font-size:30"><u>Harddrive</h4>
    <p style="font-size:30">A hard drive is a high-capacity, self-contained storage device containing a read-write mechanism plus one or more hard disks, inside a sealed unit. The term "hard drive" is actually short for "hard disk drive." The term "hard disk" refers to the actual disks inside the drive. Data is stored on a stack of disks that are mounted inside a solid encasement.</p> <img style="height: 200"; src="http://betanews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IBM-hard-disk-600x449.jpg"
<h5 style="font-size:30"><u>Power supply</h5>
    <p style="font-size:30">The power supply of the computer is what powers up the computer, the battery of the computers. The reason why you can turn ont he computer.The pwoer supply converts mains AC to low-voltage regulated DC power for the internal components of a computer. Modern personal computers universally use a switched-mode power supply. Some power supplies have a manual selector for input voltage, while others automatically adapt to the supply voltage.</p> <img style="height: 200"; src="http://p.globalsources.com/IMAGES/PDT/B1063242378/Switching-Mode-ATX-Power-Supply.jpg"
<h6 style="font-size:30"><u>Video Card</h6>
    <p style="font-size:30">A vidoe card is a printed circuit board controlling output to a display screen. It is an integrated circuit that generates the video signal sent to a computer display. The card is usually located on the computer motherboard or is a separate circuit board, but is sometimes built into the computer display unit.</p> <img style="height: 200"; src="http://www.pcsurgeons-stl.com/Video_Card_JPG_2.jpg"
<h6 style="font-size:30"><u>Sound Card</h6>
    <p style="font-size:30">A sound card is a device that can be slotted into a computer to allow the use of audio components for multimedia applications. An expansion board that enables a computer to manipulate and output sounds. Sound cards are necessary for nearly all CD-ROMs and have become commonplace on modern personal computers.</p> <img style="height: 200"; src="http://cdn-images.sewelldirect.com/products/SW-20972/SW-20972.jpg"

<h7 style="font-size:30"><u>Keyboard, Mouse, and Monitor</h7>
    <p style="font-size:30">A <strong>keyboard</strong> is the part of the computer set up that is used to type onto the screen. A <strong>mouse</strong>  is used to navigate or a pinting device. This motion is typically translated into the motion of a pointer on a display, which allows for fine control of a graphical user interface. A <strong>monitor</strong> is used for the diesplay of whatever you are doing. The screen so that you can see what you are doing. It shows the picture. </p> <img style="height: 200"; src="http://www.maximumpc.com/files/u154280/keyboard.png">
