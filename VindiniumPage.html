    <p>Vindinium is a mutli-player game that consists of up to four players at a time. Everyone is assigned one player as their own and you write code to tell your player what to do when the game is running. The goal of the game is to end up with the largest amount of gold out ouf the four players. The way you get gold is to take over mines. Mines are gaurded by goblins and you have to attack the goblins to take control of the goblins. You will create a bot that will work ideally to make you win.</p>
