        <p1>In this class we are learning about the html language and also CSS. This is being held at Summit Shasta high school. The main purpose of the class is to learn the language of coding/HTML/CSS. We are doing this through codeacademy and other coding websites. It gives us lessons on many different things you should/will need to know in order to code succefully. The content you will see later on in the webpage you will be seing a brief information paragraph about who I am and what I am like. You will also see and intro to some coding tags, you will learn what a tag is in that information and you will also learn about attributes and how they affect the writing of the document.</p1>

                    <h2>HTML</h2>
                    <p style="font-size:30">Html is the Hypertext Markup Language. This means that it is basically an online language that people use to create websites around the world. In this you can use tagging for text files to achieve font, color, graphic, and hyperlink effects. This is important because you are able to do many different things. With the wording and how the document is frormatted based on how the words look, what color they are, if they are in a table of a list of some sort etc.

                        <h3 style="font-size:35px">CSS</h3>
                        <p style="font-size:30">CSS is short for Cascading Syle Sheets. CSS is used for describing a format, or the look of the format of a document but it is written in a different kind of language than html. This is important because you can figure out and then do all of these cool thigns with the format and make it to your liking.</p>

                        <h3 style="font-size:30px"><u>Tags</u></h3>
                        <p style="font-size:30px">Tags in HTML and CSS are used to show ways you can change the way you write different thigns or the way you format something differently. For example if you were to type the "strong" <strong> tab, see how it made the words bold, that is what that tag does</strong>. And now I closed the strong tag so when i type it is no longer in bold.</p>
                        <ul style="font-size: 30px">
                            <li>Italicize Tag</li>
                            <li>Body Tag</li>
                            <li>Paragraph Tag</li>
                            <li>Heading Tag</li>

                            <body>
                                <p>The "<strong>em</strong>" tag is used when you are going to italicize a sentence or a word or a title of something, whatever you want! But you use it by putting the tag "em" in like <em>this</em>. I JUST ITALICIZED THAT! You can't see it but it looks like this when you type it;
                                    < em>and then you end it with
                                        < /em>. It would all be closer together though, if I typed it correctly it would not show up.</p>
                                <p>The body tag is used when you are going to start to write a body section in your document or paper or whatever you are writing. The tag looks like this <strong> < body > </strong> and then "/body" .</p>
                                <p>The paragraph tag is the one I am using right now. It is used to start writing a new paragraph. You will you use this tag everytime you start a new paragraph. It looks like this <strong> "p" </strong> and then <strong> "p" </strong>.You can change the font a color of the words by adding the attributes inside the "p" tag. I will talk about attributes later in this document.</p>
                                <p>And last but not least, the ehading tag. The heading tag is used to write a heading if you choose to. You write headings to title things, or head them. The heading stands out more than just regular text because that is what it is supposed to be like. The heading tag looks like this;<strong < h> </strong> and then <strong> < /h > </strong> As you start to add heading after heading you would start to add numbers after the h. You start as h1, then it would be h2,h3,h4,h5, and so on.</p>

    <h4 style="font-size:30px"><u>Attributes</u></h4>

    <body>
        <p>Attributes are the tags that are used to change the apperance of the words and letters and background color. So basically design. An attribute specifically is an HTML attribute is a modifier of an HTML element. HTML attributes generally appear as name-value pairs, separated by "=", and are written within the start tag of an element, after the element's.</p>
        <ul style="font-size:30px">
            <li>color attribute</li>
            <li>font-family attribute</li>
            <li>font-size attribute</li>
        </ul>

        <head>
            <h4 style="font-size:30px">Color</h4>

            <body>
                <p>The color attribute allows you to change the color of a word, phrase, sentence, or all the wordds on the doecument. You canc hange the color by inouting the attribute in the opening tag. it would look like this,
                    < h1 style="color:blue">. That is how you would type it if you wanted your words the be colored almost any color you want.</p>
        </head>
        </body>

        <head>
            <h3 style="font-size:30px">Font Family</h3>

            <body>
                <p>The font-family attribute is used to change the font of the text. You can change the font of any text in the document. You can change it to any font you know, but you have to know the name of that certain font and know how to spell it correclty. To change the font you inpur the attribute inside the tag.
                    < body style="font-family:Arial' >, and then the words or paragraph or sentence you chose will change to that font.</p>
</head>
</body>
<head>
<h3 style=" font-size:30px ">Font Size</h3>
<body>
    <p>The font size attribute allows you to change the font of the text inthe document. You can change the size of the font in any section of the document that you want. You can do this by putting the attribute, inside the opening tag and writing this, < body style="font-size:30px " >. After the colon you put the number font size that you want and then it will change. And you add the px after the number, px  is short for pixels.

<p style="font-size:30 ">On this page iw ill be talking about computer hardware, like different parts of the computer itself. I will be describing each parrt a little bit but not way in depth. Just describing what each part is and what is does.
<h1 style="font-size:30 "><u>Motherboard</h1>
    <p style="font-size:30 ">The motherboard is a printed circuit board containing the principal components of a computer or other device, with connectors into which other circuit boards can be slotted. The motherboard connects all parts of the computer together. It connects thigns like the CPU, memory, hard drives, optical drives, sound card, and many other things. They are all connected by either expansion cards or cables.</p> <img style="height: 200 "; src="http://www.technologyuk.net/computing/computer_systems/images/motherboard02.jpg ">
<h2 style="font-size:30 "><u>CPU</h2>
    <p style="font-size:30 ">What is CPU? CPU is the abbreviation for central processing unit. Sometimes referred to simply as the central processor, but more commonly called processor, the CPU is the brains of the computer where most calculations take place. The CPU is the brains of the computer where most calculations take place.</p> <img style="height: 200 "; src="http://www.eurotech.com/images/products/CPU-1484/CPU-1484.jpg "
<h3 style="font-size:30 "><u>RAM</h3>
    <p style="font-size:30 ">RAM is an acronym for Random Access Memory. a type of computer memory that can be accessed randomly; that is, any byte of memory can be accessed without touching the preceding bytes. RAM is the most common type of memory found in computers and other devices.</p> <img style="height: 200 "; src="http://www.downloadmoreram.com/images/ram2.jpg "
<h4 style="font-size:30 "><u>Harddrive</h4>
    <p style="font-size:30 ">A hard drive is a high-capacity, self-contained storage device containing a read-write mechanism plus one or more hard disks, inside a sealed unit. The term "hard drive " is actually short for "hard disk drive. " The term "hard disk " refers to the actual disks inside the drive. Data is stored on a stack of disks that are mounted inside a solid encasement.</p> <img style="height: 200 "; src="http://betanews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IBM-hard-disk-600x449.jpg "
<h5 style="font-size:30 "><u>Power supply</h5>
    <p style="font-size:30 ">The power supply of the computer is what powers up the computer, the battery of the computers. The reason why you can turn ont he computer.The pwoer supply converts mains AC to low-voltage regulated DC power for the internal components of a computer. Modern personal computers universally use a switched-mode power supply. Some power supplies have a manual selector for input voltage, while others automatically adapt to the supply voltage.</p> <img style="height: 200 "; src="http://p.globalsources.com/IMAGES/PDT/B1063242378/Switching-Mode-ATX-Power-Supply.jpg "
<h6 style="font-size:30 "><u>Video Card</h6>
    <p style="font-size:30 ">A vidoe card is a printed circuit board controlling output to a display screen. It is an integrated circuit that generates the video signal sent to a computer display. The card is usually located on the computer motherboard or is a separate circuit board, but is sometimes built into the computer display unit.</p> <img style="height: 200 "; src="http://www.pcsurgeons-stl.com/Video_Card_JPG_2.jpg "
<h6 style="font-size:30 "><u>Sound Card</h6>
    <p style="font-size:30 ">A sound card is a device that can be slotted into a computer to allow the use of audio components for multimedia applications. An expansion board that enables a computer to manipulate and output sounds. Sound cards are necessary for nearly all CD-ROMs and have become commonplace on modern personal computers.</p> <img style="height: 200 "; src="http://cdn-images.sewelldirect.com/products/SW-20972/SW-20972.jpg "
